        their existing diesel-propelled Category C vehicles that were registered before
        1 Jan 2001 and register a replacement vehicle within 1 month of de-registration
        by paying a discounted Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP) under the ETS. From
        1 Aug 2015, the ETS was extended to existing diesel-propelled Category C vehicles
        that were registered between 1 Jan 2001 and 30 Sep 2006 and will be de-registered
